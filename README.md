# Project goal
We all got this feeling now and then that technology is going too fast and we are longing for the ‘good old days’. This project aims to create a back in the days feeling. So get sentimental and join us in our time travel to 1988. The days of the Nokia 3310 and the first version of Snake.

# The Five Planes Of UX Design

## Strategy
<hr>
With the game, I want to offer the user an enjoyable and challenging gameplay and let them experience the old days. The game itself is very simple and based on Snake developed and  published by Gremlin in 1976 under the name Blockade.

### Game concept

The player controls a dot which represent a snake. The snake has to eat objects to grow and to increase the players' score. The player loses when the snake runs into itself and, depending on the game mode, runs into the screen border.

The game is mainly known by older generations, so I want to give the website a nineties design  to create correct atmosphere connected with the game.  

The game needs to work on multiple devices and resolutions. The controls of the game should be intuitive and simple.

### User Stories 
- As a site owner, I want my site to perform well so that my users do not have to wait on the game to load

- As a site owner, I want my site to size depended on the device which is played on so my users can play on all devices

- As a site owner, I want to give my user the feeling of competition so that my user is triggered to come back and improve their gameplay

- As a user, I want to select the game mode, that I can make the game more challenging

- As a user, I want to play the game on all devices, that I can always improve my gameplay whatever the device I use.

- As a returning user, I want to see my performance in comparison with the best performance, that I know my standings in the competition

## Scope
In this paragraph the scope of the initial project will be decided as well further improvements will be discussed. The scope is represented in different features. 

### Minimum Viable Product
Within the scope of this project, there are some features needed to make an ‘MVP’, minimum viable product. Those main features are:

- Game mode feature

- Game feature

- Control feature

- Game over feature

### Nice To Have
Nevertheless, more features can be added to the minimum viable product to make the game more attractive to the users.

- Welcome screen feature

- Levels feature

- Scoreboard feature

- Animate screen transition

- Leader board feature

- Swipe control feature

## Structure
The site will contain one page which is manipulated by JavaScript.

The structure of the site is slightly different depended on what device is used. On mobile and tablet, the controls will be added as for the desktop the game is controlled by the arrow keys.

Also, the game area height and width is depended on which device the game is played. If the width of the device is lower than 510 pixels, the width of the game area will be 90% of the screen width. Otherwise, the max-width of the game area will be 510 pixels to give the user the same game experience among different screen sizes. As well the max-height will be 510 pixels. If the screen height is lower than 510 pixels, the height of the game area will be 70% of the screen height.

## Skeleton
The wireframes are made to decide how the project must look like on different devices. Further design decisions that are made along the development process will be clarified in a further section.

## Surface
The goal of the site is to give the user a relaxing moment to mesmerize about the old days while enjoying the game of snake. The design will be simple with warm colours.

The important content will be always centered in the middle of the screen so the users don’t have to actively look for buttons or content.

Lastly, the contrast is maximized to draw attention to an important aspect of the screen which is the game area.

### Background
As background image a snake drawing is used. This snake will be grayed out when the game is lost.

### Colors
The colours are a combination of yellow, blue, white, and green. The colours are carefully selected to maximize the contrast to make the game visible also for people suffering from colour blindness.

The next pallet is used in the project.

### Typography
In order to maximize the 1990’s feeling the HachiMaruPop font is used in this project.

HachiMaruPop is a cute font that was popular among young Japanese girls in the 1970s and 1980s. It has an informal handwritten appearance which works well at larger sizes.
